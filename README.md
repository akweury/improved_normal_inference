# Improved Normal Inference
ssh

## Usage
The output folder will save normal maps with a copy of ground truth

1. run ply_generator.py to generate ply file, which is based on ground truth normal map.
2. run knn_normal.py to generate knn normal map

### TODO List:
- reformat the code as a decent starting point
- A proper evaluation metric
- A standard basic model dataset for very first validation of algorithms
